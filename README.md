This is the complete source code compilation of all code listings in the book
Pro MERN Stack by Vasan Subramanian, published by Apress. The book can be purchased at any of these websites:

   * [Apress](http://www.apress.com/in/book/9781484226520)
   * [Springer](http://www.springer.com/gb/book/9781484226520)

Each section in the book ends with a working application, which corresponds to a branch in this
repository. For each section, you can browse the complete source, or look at the differences from
the previous section/step using the appropriate link against each section, in this page.

### Demo

There is no online demo, so if you want to take a peek into how the app will look like once it's
done till the end of the book, you will need to do the following:

   1. Install Node.js (with npm) and MongoDB
   2. Clone this repository
   3. Run `npm install` in the project directory
   4. Run `npm run compile`, followed by `npm run compile-server` to generate the bundles
   5. Run `npm start` to start the server on port 3000
   6. (Optionally) Run `mongo scripts/init.mongo.js` to seed the database with some initial data

The above requires that you know, or able to find out how to install Node.js and MongoDB.
